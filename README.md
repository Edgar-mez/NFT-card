## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I reinforced knowledge of both HTML and CSS, Learning a little more about the application of some attributes and how they work on the website that is being developed.

### Continued development

I would like to work with the CSS framework tailwind with which I have not worked much but I find it interesting, for this challenge I planned to make use of some framework such as Reactjs, Bootstrap or tailwind but I preferred to test my skills without support from some framework or library.
